Observations:
Session Management: You're using Flask's built-in session to manage state across requests. This is fine for a simple app, but do note that it's not suitable for a production environment if scalability is a concern.

Database Connections: You're using SQLite for your database, and opening a new connection every time you fetch clues. For this scale, this might be fine, but consider using a connection pool for more efficient use of resources in larger applications.

Error Handling: The error handling seems to be somewhat minimalistic. While this may work for a smaller, non-critical application, robust error handling is crucial for production-level applications.

Frontend: The HTML seems fairly straightforward. It uses Jinja2 templates to dynamically display data.

Potential Improvements:
Separate Game Logic: Consider separating the game logic from the Flask routing logic. This would make the code more maintainable.

Robust Error Handling: Use Flask's built-in error-handling capabilities for more robust and user-friendly error messages.

Database Connection Pooling: Consider using a connection pool to manage database connections more efficiently.

UI/UX Enhancements: The frontend is quite minimalistic; perhaps consider using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js for a better user experience.

Configuration Management: Use a configuration file or environment variables for setting things like database credentials, making it easier to manage and more secure.

API: Instead of handling everything on the server, you could create an API that the frontend consumes. This would make it easier to extend the game to other platforms in the future.

Testing: Consider adding automated tests for both the backend logic and the frontend.
